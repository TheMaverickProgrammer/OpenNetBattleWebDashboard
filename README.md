# About
The [Web Data API](https://github.com/TheMaverickProgrammer/OpenNetBattleWebDataAPI) is just a HTTP RESTful service on top of the datastore. This project is the visual component that users will see.

Both of these web projects constitute the data-management solution for the [Open Net Battle](https://github.com/TheMaverickProgrammer/OpenNetBattle) engine.

## Disclaimer
Contributing is always welcome. However there will be no official tutorials or help form me personally on how to use this software. 

# Building
